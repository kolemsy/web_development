--->Backtracking Intro
When working on a Git project, sometimes we make changes that we 
want to get rid of.

--->head commit
In Git, the commit you are currently on is known as the HEAD 
commit. In many cases, the most recently made commit is the HEAD 
commit
To see the HEAD commit, enter:

git show HEAD

--->git checkout
What if you decide to change the ghost’s line in the working 
directory, but then decide you wanted to discard that change?

git checkout HEAD filename

will restore the file in your working directory to look exactly 
as it did when you last made a commit.

--->more git add
git add filename_1 filename_2

git add . #adds all the files
--->git reset 
We can unstage that file from the staging area using
git reset HEAD filename

--->Just like retracing your steps on that hike, Git enables you to 
rewind to the part before you made the wrong turn. You can do 
this with
git reset commit_SHA

Summary
git checkout HEAD filename: Discards changes in the working directory.
git reset HEAD filename: Unstages file changes in the staging area.
git reset commit_SHA: Resets to a previous commit in your commit history.
