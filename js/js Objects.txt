--->let spaceship = {}; // spaceship is an empty object

--->// An object literal with two key-value pairs
let spaceship = {
  'Fuel Type': 'diesel',
  color: 'silver'
};
--->Accessing Properties
1 the dot notation:
	spaceship.color
2 bracket notation:
	spaceship['Fuel type']
---> Property Assignment
	Objects are mutable, we can update them using = operator.
---> Delete property:
	delete spaceship.color
---> When data stored on an object is a function, we call that a 
 method.
const alienShip = {
  invade () { 
    console.log('Hello! We have come to dominate your planet. Instead of Earth, it shall be called New Xaculon.')
  }
};
same as
const alienShip = {
  invade: function () { 
    console.log('Hello! We have come to dominate your planet. Instead of Earth, it shall be called New Xaculon.')
  }
};

---> accessing methods
alienShip.invade();

---> nested objects:
An object may have another object

const spaceship = {
     telescope: {
        yearBuilt: 2018,
        model: '91031-XLT',
        focalLength: 2032 
     },
    crew: {
        captain: { 
            name: 'Sandra', 
            degree: 'Computer Engineering', 
            encourageTeam() { console.log('We got this!') } 
         }
    },
    engine: {
        model: 'Nimbus2000'
     },
     nanoelectronics: {
         computer: {
            terabytes: 100,
            monitors: 'HD'
         },
        'back-up': {
           battery: 'Lithium',
           terabytes: 50
         }
    }
}; 

spaceship.nanoelectronics['back-up'].battery; // Returns 'Lithium'

---> Pass by Reference
Objects are passed by reference. This means when we pass a 
variable assigned to an object into a function as an argument,
 the computer interprets the parameter name as pointing to the 
space in memory holding that object. As a result, functions which 
change object properties actually mutate the object permanently
 (even when the object is assigned to a const variable).

const spaceship = {
  homePlanet : 'Earth',
  color : 'silver'
};

let paintIt = obj => {
  obj.color = 'glorious gold'
};

paintIt(spaceship);

spaceship.color // Returns 'glorious gold'
