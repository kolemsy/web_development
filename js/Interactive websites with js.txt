---> the defer attribute
The defer attribute specifies scripts should be executed after 
the HTML file is completely parsed

<script src="example.js" defer></script>
When is defer useful?

When a script contains functionality that requires interaction
with the DOM, the defer attribute is the way to go.

---> The Async Attribute
This means that, similar to the defer attribute, the HTML parser 
will continue parsing the rest of the HTML as the script is 
downloaded in the background. However, with the async attribute,
 the script will not wait until the entire page is parsed: it will
 execute immediately after it has been downloaded. eg

<script src="example.js" async></script>
async is useful for scripts that are independent of other scripts
 in order to function accordingly.
