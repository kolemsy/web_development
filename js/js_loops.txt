--->for loop:
	for(initialization, stopping condition, iteration statement){
     }
--->looping in reverse:
	same as up
--->Looping through array
const animals = ['Grizzly Bear', 'Sloth', 'Sea Lion'];
for (let i = 0; i < animals.length; i++){
  console.log(animals[i]);
}
--->The While loop:
	// A for loop that prints 1, 2, and 3
for (let counterOne = 1; counterOne < 4; counterOne++){
  console.log(counterOne);
}

// A while loop that prints 1, 2, and 3
let counterTwo = 1;
while (counterTwo < 4) {
  console.log(counterTwo);
  counterTwo++;
}
--->Do..While:
let cupsOfSugarNeeded = 5;
let cupsAdded = 0; 
do {
  cupsAdded ++
} while(cupsAdded < cupsOfSugarNeeded);

--->break
