--->Locating Silent Bugs
An incredibly powerful tool for locating bugs is a method you 
likely learned very early on in your JavaScript journey:
console.log()!

--->Debugging with console.log()

1. Go to the beginning of the malfunctioning code. Print out all 
starting variables, existing values, and arguments using 
console.log().
2. After the next piece of logic in your code, add console.log() 
statements to ensure updated variables have the values that you 
now expect and that the block of code is being executed.

--->Finding documentation

Sometimes once you’ve tracked down a bug, you might still be 
confused on how to fix it! Whenever you want to know more about 
how JavaScript works and what it can do, the best place to go is 
documentation.
